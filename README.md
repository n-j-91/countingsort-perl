Counting Sort Algorithm for Perl

This is a simple implementation of counting sort algorithm in perl.


This sub routine takes two references as arguments.
1. key_pt -> Array of integers on based which the sorting will happen.
2. $val_pt -> Array of actual data. Values could be simple strings or complex data structures.

This will return a pointer to a sorted array of actual data.
